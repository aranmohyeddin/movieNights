# Following - Christopher Nolan(1998)

## Review

* We have three stories, 1. bill-cobb, 2. bill-blonde, 3. bill-bald that happen
    sequentially in time but are narrated in parallel, each section is split in 5 parts and
    they there five parts are zipped together to make up the whole movie, Except that 14
    and 15 are switched and the openning and ending of the movie.

* Each story begins with Bill following the person and ends with a big revelation which
    is always disclosed by Cobb at Blonde's house through a conversation between them.

* Each person is in control of the events in their story, first Cobb, then Blonde, and
    finally the Bald guy. The bald guy is controlling everything through Cobb, but Cobb
    makes it clear that the bald guy is micromanaging everything through saying 
    > The old man was very specific about how I should do things. 

    and then,
    > He was very precise about exactly how and where I should take care of things. Something about a bloodstained carpet... that you've got stashed away to back up your story...

### <summary> how did the earing get in his shoebox? </summary> 
<p> most likely the girl put it there after the bar </p>

> Surprisingly enough, I thought you might be able to give me some advice.

> \- Steel whip. Nunchucks, they're all right. Tools are good, sharpened screwdriver, hammer, chisel

> \- "Hammer"?

> \- Yeah. Medium size. Good rubber grip. It's very nasty. If you get a claw hammer, you can pry doors with it. Slip it into the back of your waistband, you're set.

there were a couple of hammers in the old house, influencing bill's sub-conscious
</p>

## I was wondering...
<details><summary>If you were the police, how could you have found out the truth?</summary>
<p>
One possible trace would be that the random girl who was cheating on her boyfriend saw
them in the restaurant and saw that Cobb gave the card to Bill and he signed it and paid
the bill with it, and then it could be matched with the records of the restaurant that
danielt lyoid paid the bill. But she might not want to risk her relationship.

## Interesting philosophical thoughts raised in the movie

> How can I explain?
You ever...
been to a football match, just let your eyes...
go over, drift across a crowd of people... and they slowly stop and fix on one person...
and all of a sudden that person isn't part of the crowd anymore?
They've become an individual, just like that.

> It's like a diary. They hide it, but actually they want someone to see it.
> That's what I do. Concealment, display, flip sides of the same coin.
This way they know that someone's seen it.
That's what it's all about, interrupting someone's life...
making them see all the things they took for granted.
Like when they go back and buy all this stuff from the shelves...
with the insurance money, they'll have to think...
for the first time in a long time...
why they wanted all this stuff, what it's for.
You take it away... and show them what they had.

> Saucy, eh? (shows a pair of panties)
Found these in the last flat.
Think I'll just give them something to chat about.

> \- Why would you do that?

> \- She'll find them in his trousers and ask him what he's been doing.

> \- Yeah, but why would you want to fuck up their relationship?

> \- Don't you listen? You take it away... and show them what they had.

> I thought the whole point of burglary was taking things.

> \- No, this is the point, breaking in, entering someone's life... 
> finding out who they really are. I mean, don't you just feel it?
> Standing here... drinking their wine, people we'll never even meet.
